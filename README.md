The Music Application project is a web-based platform designed to provide users with a seamless and enjoyable music 
streaming experience. The project encompasses features for three main user roles: Creators, Users, and Administrators. 
Creators can upload, manage, and share their music, while Users can discover and enjoy a wide range of songs and albums. 
Administrators have tools to oversee user activity, manage flagged content, and perform administrative tasks.
